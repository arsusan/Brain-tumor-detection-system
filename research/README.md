# Brain Tumor Detection using Custom CNN

A complete deep learning system for binary classification of brain tumors from MRI images using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## 📋 Project Overview

This project implements a custom CNN from scratch (no transfer learning) for binary classification of brain MRI images into:

- **Tumor** (Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary combined)
- **No Tumor**

### Key Features

- ✅ Custom CNN built from scratch (no pretrained models)
- ✅ Binary classification (Tumor vs No Tumor)
- ✅ Memory-efficient data pipeline with generators
- ✅ Comprehensive data augmentation
- ✅ Advanced callbacks (early stopping, model checkpointing, LR scheduling)
- ✅ Detailed evaluation metrics and visualizations
- ✅ Ready-to-use scripts for training, evaluation, and prediction
- ✅ Modular and extensible architecture
